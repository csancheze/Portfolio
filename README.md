The task was to build a Webpage to include a portfolio of my work from zero. It specially had to be adequately formatted to be accesible. 

In order to achieve this the HTML structure was built to resemble the example.
Then, the css formatting was done with normal pc screens in mind.
After that, it was necessary to make adjustments to be accesible from different devices. Finally, after a couple of adjustments, it was finished.

For the Update, a copy of the original repository was made. 

Must of the old Css was deleted and started working with Bootstrap and CSS to make a responsive design for mobile first. Then adjustments were added in CSS for a good look on wider screens.

After must of the style was done, the newer projects were added. Some of the HTML was also changed to add some icons to the contact information and to use some bootstrap components correctly.

A google font was added at the end along with some style corrections for it to look correctly.

Tecnologies used:
-HTML.
-CSS.
-Bootstrap.
-Google Fonts.
-Font Awesome
